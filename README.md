# Unsupervised-ML-algorithm-for-galaxy-classification

This is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm involving several clustering and data size reduction techniques to produce a number between 150 and 200 galaxy clusters each containing objects with similar morphological features. The code currently takes as inputs individual galaxy images (in .npy format) from the Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC) survey and catalogs with galaxy redshifts, stellar masses, HSC star flags.
